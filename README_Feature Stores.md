* [Feature Store for Machine Learning (FEAST)](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast)  ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/feast-dev/feast.svg?style=social) - Feast (Feature Store) is a tool for managing and serving machine learning features. Feast is the bridge between models and data.
* [Hopsworks Feature Store](https://github.com/logicalclocks/hopsworks) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/logicalclocks/hopsworks.svg?style=social) - Offline/Online Feature Store for ML [(Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1BjPk1smdg).
* [Ivory](https://github.com/antony-a1/ivory)  ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/antony-a1/ivory.svg?style=social) - ivory defines a specification for how to store feature data and provides a set of tools for querying it. It does not provide any tooling for producing feature data in the first place. All ivory commands run as MapReduce jobs so it assumed that feature data is maintained on HDFS.
* [Veri](https://github.com/bgokden/veri) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bgokden/veri.svg?style=social) - Veri is a Feature Label Store. Feature Label store allows storing features as keys and labels as values. Querying values is only possible with knn using features. Veri also supports creating sub sample spaces of data by default.
